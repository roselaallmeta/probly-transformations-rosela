# Probly – Personal Contribution
This repository contains my personal work from the Probly project, a university group project at LMU Munich focused on probabilistic machine learning and uncertainty quantification.


### Project Overview
This repository includes the part of the work I’ve done for the **Probly** project, a group assignment at **LMU Munich**.  
Probly is a Python library that deals with **probabilistic machine learning** and **uncertainty quantification**.  
The main idea is to build tools that help models not only make predictions but also express how confident they are.

### My Work
I worked mainly on:
- Implementing and testing **evidential classification transformations**
- Calculating and visualizing **uncertainty metrics** (total, aleatoric, epistemic)
- Creating **Jupyter notebooks** that explain these transformations and how they behave in practice



### Tech Stack
- Python (PyTorch, JAX, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)
- pytest (testing), Git (version control)
